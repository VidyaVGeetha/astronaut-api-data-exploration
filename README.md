# Astronaut API Data Exploration (IBM Mini Project)

This mini project demonstrates how to collect and analyze data from a public API using Python. 
The project retrieves real-time astronaut data from the Open Notify API, processes the JSON response, 
and extracts insights such as the total number of people currently in space and their names.

This work was completed as part of the IBM Data Analyst learning program.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Access a public API using Python
- Convert API responses from JSON format into Python objects
- Extract meaningful information from structured data
- Display astronaut count and list of names programmatically

---

## 🧩 What the Project Does

The notebook performs the following tasks:

- Sends an API request to  
  `http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json`
- Reads the JSON response
- Extracts:
  - Total number of astronauts in space (`number`)
  - List of astronauts (`people`)
- Prints the astronaut count and their names

Example insights produced:

- Number of people currently in space
- Names of astronauts
- Spacecraft they are aboard (ISS / Tiangong)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter
2. Run all cells
3. Ensure internet access (API is live online)
4. The notebook will print:
   - astronaut count
   - astronaut names
